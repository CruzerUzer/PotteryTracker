# PotteryTracker Nginx Configuration with HTTPS
# This file should be copied to /etc/nginx/sites-available/potterytracker
# Then symlinked: sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/potterytracker /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
#
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Update server_name to match your domain (replace yourdomain.com below)
# 2. Update root path to your frontend/dist directory
# 3. Test: sudo nginx -t
# 4. Reload: sudo systemctl reload nginx
# 5. Run certbot: sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
#    (Certbot will automatically add HTTPS configuration)

# HTTP server block
# This serves your app initially, then certbot will add HTTPS and redirect
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;

    # Allow Let's Encrypt ACME challenge (required for certbot)
    location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
        root /var/www/html;
    }

    # Serve your application over HTTP initially
    # After certbot runs, it will add HTTPS and change this to redirect

}

# HTTPS server block
# NOTE: Certbot will automatically add this entire block when you run:
# sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
#
# Certbot will:
# 1. Create a new server block for port 443
# 2. Add SSL certificate paths
# 3. Configure SSL settings
# 4. Change the HTTP block above to redirect to HTTPS
#
# You don't need to manually create this - certbot does it for you!
